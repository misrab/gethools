# usage

run `npm install -g` in this folder to update the terminal commands defined in
`package.json` "bin"

then run `gest [cmd]` as specified in `package.json` "bin". This requires the above; one could also
add a command like `gesht` to `~/.bash_profile` to avoid compiling each time, which I prefer (that
requires the code path).
